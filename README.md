This app serves as a ladder for League of Legends.

A lot of the existing code is ugly. Some of it has been ugly for a while, and some of it was recently made ugly while I quickly fixed a lot of broken parts of the site (real life got in the way of maintaining it). Cleaning things up is my main priority once the site is running how I want it to be.

Rebuilding the existing Python codebase for this site into Rails was the first project I tackled after making the decision to learn Ruby.
