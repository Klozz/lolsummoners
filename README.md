This app serves as a ladder for League of Legends.

The site is currently live at http://www.lolsummoners.com, but the code in this repository is not currently pushed up to live.
Currently in the process of making things work properly again. Some code is ugly and will be refactored in the future.

Rebuilding the existing Python codebase for this site into Rails was the first project I tackled after making the decision to learn Ruby.
